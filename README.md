# eyeVis

This matlab package is for visualising gaze eyetracking data.

Currently it includes heatmap plots, and heatmap and swarm videos.
Can read data from csv files, or folders, or already loaded tables.
There is a demo script to show an example, but no data to run it with.

To do:

- [ ] Add more detailed instructions (possibly with a demo dataset)
- [x] Add heatmap video script (to account for different trials per kid)
- [ ] Add option for presenting pupil timecourse
- [ ] Add (again) groups/conditions, as in different colours in the same plot, or side-by-side
- [ ] Add option for title

version history:

2022-07-23 Rewrote scripts without matlab plotting functions, added heatmaps, removed "settings" class and simplified function inputs.
